# Trading-Environment-with-Stable-baseline3

The BTCUSD data taken from -> https://www.marketwatch.com/

** This trading environment is only for learning purpose **
I am not a professional in this field, based on the models it seemed quite fine for me.

Here I used gym and gym_anytrading for the environment. And two models A2C and PPO for
training the model. PPO seem to perform better than A2C in a less time of training.
